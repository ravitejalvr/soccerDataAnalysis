# Soccer Data Analysis
Soccer Data Analysis for publishing analysis data directly on Std output

Hello!

I am including this document to give instructions on how to run the code.

I have used python for analysis in this code and for the code to run, python - 3 or above needs to be installed on 
the test setup

To run the code and get analysis, once python is setup, just run "python soccer_analysis.py" on terminal or windows shell.

Please note that this analysis assumes that soccer.csv file is in same directory as python file

Also, to run the python code, you may need to enter the same directory as the file.

Thanks!
