AdhereHealth code exercise instructions
=======================================

The soccer.csv file contains the results from the English Premier League.

Write a program to read the file, then print the following stats:

- Show the team with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goals.
- List the top 10 teams with the highest win percentage.
- Full stats for team with the most draws (include all columns available in CSV file)

All output should be directed to STDOUT and instructions on how to run the program should be included.

Thanks!
